# Front End Homework

I implemented a React app that calls the Giphy API for alien gifs.

It features side scrolling and infinite ajax scrolling/loading.

I could of wired up a input that lets you change the query to the API from aliens to something else, but I'm sure every example you receive back has that. I wanted to show you that I can handle an array of complicated tasks such as dealing with redux and complex flexbox layouts.
